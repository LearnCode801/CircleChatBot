# Startup Recommendation System

## Overview

The Startup Recommendation System is designed to provide insightful and relevant recommendations to users based on their startup ideas. Users can input detailed descriptions and details about their proposed startup, and the system will match these with a database of 4361 startups to provide helpful data and insights.

## Features

- **Detailed Query Handling**: Users can input comprehensive descriptions of their startup ideas.
- **Contextual Matching**: The system matches user input with a rich database of startup information.
- **Relevant Recommendations**: Provides users with relevant data about existing startups similar to their idea.
- **User-Friendly Responses**: Clear and concise responses to user queries, focusing on startups and business information.

## Data

The system uses the following data fields for each startup:
- `company_id`
- `company_name`
- `short_description`
- `long_description`
- `batch`
- `status`
- `tags`
- `location`
- `country`
- `year_founded`
- `num_founders`
- `founders_names`
- `team_size`
- `website`
- `cb_url` (Crunchbase URL)
- `linkedin_url`

## Usage

### Prompt Template

The system uses a prompt template to structure responses. Here is the template used:

```plaintext
prompt_template="""
Use the following information to answer the user's question about their startup idea. If you don't know the answer, say that you don't know and do not attempt to fabricate a response.

Context:
Company ID: {company_id}
Company Name: {company_name}
Short Description: {short_description}
Long Description: {long_description}
Batch: {batch}
Status: {status}
Tags: {tags}
Location: {location}
Country: {country}
Year Founded: {year_founded}
Number of Founders: {num_founders}
Founders Names: {founders_names}
Team Size: {team_size}
Website: {website}
Crunchbase URL: {cb_url}
LinkedIn URL: {linkedin_url}

Question: {question}

If the question is not related to startups or business, respond with:
"I'm sorry, I am a startup recommendation chatbot. Please ask a question related to startups or business."
"""
```

### Example Usage

Users can query the system by providing their startup idea and receiving information about similar existing startups. For example:

```plaintext
Question: "I want to start a social media platform for pet owners to share and connect. What similar startups are there?"
```

The system will then provide details on relevant startups based on the context of the user's query.
