## Overview

The Circle Chatbot is Startup Recommendation System which designed to provide insightful and relevant recommendations to users based on their startup ideas. Users can input detailed descriptions and details about their proposed startup, and the system will match these with a database of 4361 startups to provide helpful data and insights.

## Features

- **Detailed Query Handling**: Users can input comprehensive descriptions of their startup ideas.
- **Contextual Matching**: The system matches user input with a rich database of startup information.
- **Relevant Recommendations**: Provides users with relevant data about existing startups similar to their idea.
- **User-Friendly Responses**: Clear and concise responses to user queries, focusing on startups and business information.

## Data

The system uses the following data fields for each startup:
- `company_id`
- `company_name`
- `short_description`
- `long_description`
- `batch`
- `status`
- `tags`
- `location`
